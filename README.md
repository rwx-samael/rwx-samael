Hey there, you can call me *Az*.

I’m mainly interested in red teaming, malware/exploit development, OS internals, and Active Directory.
When it comes to programming, I know C++, C, Go, and Python.

Also, I’m very friendly, definitely not the type of person to put “nohello” in their bio xd (I get the purpose behind it, no offense).

Feel free to say hello anytime! I’d love to be your friend :D
